Epson Photo inkprinter R2000
In 1994 Epson started outsourcing sales reps to help sell their products in retail stores in the United States. 
The same year, they started the Epson Weekend Warrior sales program.
The purpose of the program was to help improve sales, improve retail 
sales reps' knowledge of Epson products and to address Epson customer 
service in a retail environment. Reps were assigned on weekend shift, 
typically around 12â€“20 hours a week. Epson started the Weekend Warrior 
Concatanation file2
program with TMG Marketing (now Mosaic Sales Solutions), later with 
Keystone Marketing Inc, then to Mosaic, and now with Campaigners INC.
The Mosaic contract expired with Epson on June 24, 2007 and Epson is 
now represented by Campaigners, Inc. The sales reps of Campaigners, 
Inc. are not outsourced as Epson hired "rack jobbers" to ensure their 
retail customers displayed products properly. This frees up their regular
sales force to concentrate on profitable sales solutions to VAR's 
and system integrators, leaving "retail" to reps who did not require sales skills.
